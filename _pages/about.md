ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! Iâ€™m a Machine Intelligence and Data Science graduate from IIT Delhi, where I spent my time exploring the intersection of algorithms and real-world data. My work spans Computer Vision, NLP, Graph ML, and Data Miningâ€”trying to make machines see, read, and reason a little better. Before that, I earned my BTech in Computer Science from Nirma University and worked as a Software Developer at Informatica Business Solutions in Bengaluru for 1.5 years.

When I'm not deciphering patterns in data, I'm lost in fiction or chasing the perfect film that nobody talks about. I have a deep appreciation for classical musicâ€”Debussy, Vivaldi, Satie, and my forever favourite, Chopinâ€”hoping one day to figure out why machines can crunch numbers but can't feel a nocturne.

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! ðŸš€
